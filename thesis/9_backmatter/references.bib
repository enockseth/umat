	abstract = {{AbstractRoad} transport forms part of the daily activities of individuals and it is the principal mode of transport in Ghana. In many parts of the world, individuals tend to use their private vehicles due to lack of satisfaction they derive from the services of public transport. In this paper, passengers satisfaction with public transport services in Ghana has been investigated using binary logistic regression model. Among the sampled passengers, the results indicate that 15\%, 63.2\%, 20.8\% and 1\% believed that the overall service quality of public transport is excellent, good, moderate and poor respectively. From the estimated binary logit model, passengers rating for overall service quality tend to increase when they are satisfied with service components such as fare structure ({OR}=1.897; 95\%{CI}=1.08-3.33), crime rate at bus station ({OR}=1.829, 95\%{CI}=1.05-3.18) and traffic safety record of the bus ({OR}=4.407; 95\%{CI}=2.64-7.36). It was established that, passenger's satisfaction with public transport service is highly influenced by bus traffic safety record. Thus, to retain existing and attract new users, policies relating to passengers safety and comfort as well as fare and control of crime rate at the bus station should be targeted and improved upon. They are the service components that users valued most.},

	abstract = {Abstract: After private cars, minibus taxis are the most common transport mode in South Africa. Especially for low-income citizens living in townships, minibus services are often the only possibility for mobility. Despite the great importance of the mode, there is very little knowledge of routes, fares, and the number of minibuses. Hence, it is difficult to simulate and to understand the influence of this mode on other modes and on transport planning in general. This article presents the development of the first "close-to-reality" minibus supply model based on demand and street network only. The approach adopts the survival-of-the-fittest principle, using a co-evolutionary algorithm that is integrated into a microscopic multi-agent simulation framework. The successful application of the approach to a large-scale, real-world scenario in the Nelson Mandela Bay Area Municipality in South Africa shows that it is able to identify the main minibus corridors as well as to find robust service coverage in lower-demand areas. The resulting minibus supply model can then be used for planning purposes (e.g., to investigate aspects of strategic, operational, or regulatory changes).},
