Information about public transport operators and terminals in Ghana and most Africa countries, where transportation by road is a major means in relation to routes they operate, departure times, fares and location is not easy to come by when planning trip ahead unless you visit these terminals where information is readily available in most cases; sometimes relying on word of mouth from other travelers which could be valid or invalid. This project seeks to make it easier for travelers to find the required information on transport terminals in Ghana for effective trip planning and decision making. In conclusion a public transport search web portal application was developed. The application was developed using data collected and mapped into OpenStreetMap database, the data was extracted, cleaned and analysed in QGIS and used to create a geodatabase; using PostgreSQL and PostGIS to suit the needs of this project. The geodatabase can also be accessed by other stakeholders externally without interacting with the web application.
