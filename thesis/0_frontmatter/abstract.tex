Public transport by road is the major means of transportation in Ghana. Information about operators, routes operated, departure times, location, etc are not readily available to the public outside the stations. This project seeks to make it easier for travelers to find information on transport routes and terminals in Ghana, enabling effective trip planning and decision making. A public transport search web portal application was developed to make access to route information easier for travelers. The application was developed using data collected and mapped into OpenStreetMap database. The data was extracted, cleaned and analysed in QGIS.  A geodatabase  was created using PostgreSQL and PostGIS to suit the needs of this project. The geodatabase can also be accessed by other stakeholders externally without interacting with the web application.
